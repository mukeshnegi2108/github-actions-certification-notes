## Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform that enables you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code. By leveraging Docker containers within jobs, you can create reproducible, isolated environments tailored to your application's requirements.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Docker Containers**: Encapsulated environments that package code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Containers ensure consistency across different systems.
- **Jobs**: A job is a collection of steps executed on the same runner. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.
- **Runners**: Virtual machines or containers that execute workflow jobs.
- **Steps**: Individual tasks within a job, such as running commands or using actions.

---

## Why Use Docker in GitHub Actions?

- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures the same environment is used for every workflow run.
- **Dependency Isolation**: Prevents conflicts between dependencies of different jobs or projects.
- **Customizability**: Use any public or private Docker image, or build your own.
- **Parallelism**: Run multiple jobs in different containers simultaneously.
- **Service Integration**: Easily spin up databases or other services as containers for integration testing.

---

## Basic Usage

To run a job inside a Docker container, specify the `container` key in your workflow YAML:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:14
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

**Explanation:**
- `runs-on`: The base runner OS (required even when using containers).
- `container.image`: The Docker image to use for the job.
- All steps run inside the specified container.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Docker Images

You can use your own Docker images, either from Docker Hub or a registry like GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

```yaml
container:
  image: ghcr.io/your-org/your-custom-image:latest
  credentials:
    username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

**Tip:** Build and push your custom image as part of your workflow for full automation.

### Service Containers

Service containers provide additional containers (e.g., databases) accessible to your job:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: python:3.10
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:14
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

**Note:** Service containers are accessible via `localhost` and are automatically networked with the main job container.

### Multi-Container Jobs

You can define multiple jobs, each with its own container, and control their execution order using `needs`:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:20
    steps:
      # build steps

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: python:3.11
    needs: build
    steps:
      # test steps
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Pin Image Versions:** Always specify exact image tags (e.g., `node:20.10.0`) to avoid unexpected changes.
- **Use Small Base Images:** Prefer slim or alpine variants for faster startup and lower resource usage.
- **Cache Dependencies:** Use GitHub Actions cache to speed up builds.
- **Secure Secrets:** Use GitHub Secrets for credentials and sensitive data.
- **Clean Up:** Remove temporary files or containers if you build them during the workflow.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **File Permissions:** The default user in some images may not have the necessary permissions. Use the `options` key to set user/group.
- **Networking Issues:** Service containers are only accessible via `localhost` from the main job container.
- **Missing Tools:** Some minimal images lack common tools (e.g., `curl`, `git`). Install them as needed in your workflow.
- **Docker-in-Docker:** If you need to build Docker images inside a container, use the `docker` service or `setup-docker` action.
